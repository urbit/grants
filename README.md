# Urbit Grants

[â†’ Prod site](http://grants.urbit.org)

This is a collection of the various services and components that make up the Urbit Grants.

The website consists of a collection of four Heroku apps.  Currently, we directly deploy our code to Heroku (not through GitHub).  

For development, see the [stage branch README](https://github.com/urbit/grants/blob/stage/README.md) for important information about the current dev setup.  

### Setup

Instructions for each respective component can be found in:

- `/backend/README.md`

- `/frontend/README.md`

- `/admin/README.md`

- `/e2e/README.md`

We currently only offer instructions for unix based systems. Windows may or may not be compatible.

### Heroku

Our heroku setup uses separate apps for each component of the monorepo.

Be sure to replace `myappbasename` with your own base-name.

**Create**
Execute the `heroku-create-apps` script

```bash
chmod u+x heroku-create-apps
./heroku-create-apps myappbasename
```

This should generate apps and set up git remotes to deploy to.

**Add**
If the apps have already been created, and you want to be able to deploy to them, you
may use the heroku commands below to setup remotes.

```bash
heroku git:remote -a myappbasename-backend -r myappbasename-backend
heroku git:remote -a myappbasename-frontend -r myappbasename-frontend
heroku git:remote -a myappbasename-admin -r myappbasename-admin
heroku git:remote -a myappbasename-eip712 -r myappbasename-eip712
```

**Setup**

Add addons to the following dynos:
* Backend
  * Postgres (Standard 0 if you want backups)
    heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app=<APP_NAME>
* Backend, Frontend, EIP-712
  * Timber (Optional logging)
  
Initialize the database by running

```
heroku run "cd backend && flask db upgrade" --app myappbasename-backend
```

Add environment variables for each app based on their `.env.example`. To configure everything, you'll need:
* An AWS S3 instance (see backend/README.md)
* A Sendgrid account
* Sentry apps for backend and frontend
* Twitter and GitHub OAuth apps
* An Infura instance

**Deploy**
To push to heroku, build & deploy:

```bash
git push myappbasename-backend HEAD:master
git push myappbasename-frontend HEAD:master
git push myappbasename-admin HEAD:master
git push myappbasename-eip712 HEAD:master
```
